	<p class="Txt"> Being able to be a part of TVL-ICT 11, was an <br> astonishing achievement for me. TVL-ICT is <br> one of the track/strand of Fidelis Senior High. <br> It focuses and promotes  the use and study <br> of technology. For as long as I can remember, <br> I have  dreamt of becoming a programmer. <br> At a young age, I was introduced at computers <br> that helped me in deciding for my future. <br> Technology always amuses me. Where others see <br> the technicalities, and programming as workloads, <br> I only see excitement. And choosing <br> this track was the right decision, <br> for it produces the best out of me.
